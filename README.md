To install, drop all the code into the webroot under a folder called `AwesomeContacts`

Requires ColdFusion 9.0.1

To run the tests you need to have MXUnit installed. Under the test folder, inside the Application.cfc, there is a variable called `request.appMapping`. Change this variable to the path of the application if not under the webroot as `AwesomeContacts`.
